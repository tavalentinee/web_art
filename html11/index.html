    <h1>1. What kind of website do you want to make for your final project? (Describe the finished project in detail)

    <h2>I want to create a minimalist style website that contains information about myself, artist statements and my works.
    </h2>

    <h1>2. Why do you want to make this project? (for example, you want a portfolio website for applying to things, or…you want to use this project as an opportunity to learn a new skill, or…you want a new work in your portfolio that shows off you skills as a web developer/designer/artist).</h1>

    <h2>It's mostly more about having a clear and professional place to document my artworks. And to improve my knowledge of coding. Also it would be nice if this portfolio site could also be used to apply for things.
    </h2>

    <h1> 3. What challenges (technical, conceptual, design, etc.) do you anticipate encountering in this project? To put that another way, what do you think you’ll struggle with the most with this project?
        
    </h1></h1>

    <h2>The first things I found most troublesome were probably the process of coding, since I'm completely new at coding. Additionally, I had basically just shot my artworks on my phone before, or hadn't documented it at all, and I needed to re-give them a careful shot with the camera.</h2>
